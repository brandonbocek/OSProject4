Project 4

To compile: type 'make' or 'make all'

To run: type   './oss'
			or './oss -h' for the help menu to display
			or './oss -l file to write to'
			
deleting executables: type 'make clean'

Overview:

	The program ends when the user gives a control-c signal.
	Or after 20 seconds in the virtual clock. Not 20 real seconds
	though.

	The program begins with 3 priority queues which are arrays
	of process id's and an array of structs representing the
	process control blocks. Child processes are forked every 0-2
	seconds and placed into an index in the pcb array.

	They are scheduled in accordance to the harsh scheduling algorithm
	which is based on constants alpha and beta and the average 
	wait time in the queue. When the process in the highest 
	priority queue is scheduled it is sent a signal to stop waiting
	and the process can run for all or part of its quantum based on random
	numbers generated in user.c

	After the program ends the events and final stats are displayed to the user
	in the log file. This info is also on the console at run time.
	
	Warning: project is not perfect and I don't have time to fix it.
	It seems to be generating the same process and completing it over and over again.
	So the scheduling algorithm never gets a chance to be called when it runs.
